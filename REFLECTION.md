1. **DONE:** Downloaded the skeleton code, Worked on the character bounds and attempted to make enemy ai for the first game.

2. **TODO:** Make the scene setup and have the other features of the first game workable, add actual assets to the game.

3. **PROB:** Had a hard time scheduling physicial meetings with each other at
   first, but should hopefully be better. It is also hard trying to figure out how to make a game properly, and it seems more complicated than I originally thought.
=======
1. **DONE:** Basic variables that represent the centiped game scene. A group that contains the event handlers and rectangle that represents the centipede. When the handler is triggered, the centipede randomly moves.

2. **TODO:** Add the other elements of the centipede gameplay, along with the aesthetic components.

1. **DONE:** made working code for the player input and enemy ai, and have some basic scene setup formed. Also have some minor work done on the main menu

2. **TODO:** Setup the "game" aspects of the game such as levels or score, and add in assets.

3. **PROB:** Trying to figure out what parts of javafx to use and where was difficult. I wasn't sure how to do the core gameplay loop until I realized I should use the Timeline class.

1. **DONE:** made A lot of progress on the centipede game in terms of gameplay and a lot of setup for the scene and menu as well.

2. **TODO:** Finish Centipede, start othello and get the menu setup properly

3. **PROB:** When doing the controls, I didn't understand how to make the game register how to accept multiple inputs at the same time. I got help and realized that if I use variables to check if a button is being pressed or not, it allows for multiple inputs at the same time, which made a lot of aspects of the game a lot better.
