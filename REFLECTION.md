1. **DONE:** Downloaded the skeleton code, Worked on the character bounds and attempted to make enemy ai for the first game.

2. **TODO:** Make the scene setup and have the other features of the first game workable, add actual assets to the game.

3. **PROB:** Had a hard time scheduling physicial meetings with each other at
   first, but should hopefully be better. It is also hard trying to figure out how to make a game properly, and it seems more complicated than I originally thought.
=======
1. **DONE:** Basic variables that represent the centiped game scene. A group that contains the event handlers and rectangle that represents the centipede. When the handler is triggered, the centipede randomly moves.

2. **TODO:** Add the other elements of the centipede gameplay, along with the aesthetic components.
