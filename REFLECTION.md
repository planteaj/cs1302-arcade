1. **DONE:** Downloaded the skeleton code, Worked on the character bounds and attempted to make enemy ai for the first game.

2. **TODO:** Make the scene setup and have the other features of the first game workable, add actual assets to the game.

3. **PROB:** Had a hard time scheduling physicial meetings with each other at
   first, but should hopefully be better. It is also hard trying to figure out how to make a game properly, and it seems more complicated than I originally thought.
